I am a complete newbie. My only experience prior to this class is roughly two semesters worth of knowledge in Java. Though, my first impressions with JavaScript (ES6) so far is "Wow this is a lot easier on the eyes". I haven't had to chug through entire websites dedicated to syntactic jargon like I did with Java, but then again it's only week two. This module was a great introduction, FreeCodeCamp and JSFiddle in particular were great at letting me get some answers regarding JavaScript through trial-and-error. For those interested, FreeCodeCamp is like a boot-camp styled website with exercises ranging from basic to advanced, all related to coding. The latter, JSFiddle, is exactly what it sounds like, a playground environment to test and run JavaScript code however you desire. There's also mentions of CSS and HTML, I have little to no knowledge of either. JavaScript's felt pretty intuitive as of typing this, so I'd rate it (tentatively) as a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. But given my minimal experience, take that statement with a grain of salt. A massive grain.

The contents of this course seem to be taught online for the most part, with class time being dedicated to asking questions and working on timed assessments individually and course projects in groups. We have chances to practice for said assessments online as well, and those are of great assistance, too. I really should be coding more, but I always get stuck in the "ideas phase" of what I want to make and end up daydreaming instead of actually producing anything. I think this class and its schedule can instill some discipline in me, or at least enough so that I can more easily jump into a project and start throwing things at a wall.
