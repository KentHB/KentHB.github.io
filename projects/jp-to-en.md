My mother’s side of the family is Japanese, and because of this, I was exposed to its language and culture from an early age. And while my English remains far more fluent, I’ve luckily developed a decent enough foundation in Japanese that I can somewhat translate the latter into the former. My process for translation is still in its most roughest stages. For comics (culturally known as “manga” in Japanese), I use free substitutes for Adobe Photoshop, not because of its price, but because of my desktop computer’s inability to run the program without crashing. For video interviews or livestreams, while I have dabbled with editing software similar to Sony Vegas (the most notable being the free video editor [“DaVinci Resolve”](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)), for captions with minimal editing, I just stick to Windows’ Movie Maker due to its simplicity.

For the sake of personal interest, I’ve attempted translations for the livestreams of manga author [Arawi Keiichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiichi_Arawi). However, said translations are not posted online due to being unfinished. They're both projects I've been working on for fun during my free time, so I can't guarantee a completion at the moment. Still, it's been fun trying out editors for videos and images, as well as referring to Japanese dictionaries, and, in an emergency case, using translation sites like [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) to decipher spoken words not yet in my vernacular. Might even be good practice to simplify and articulate what it is you want to convey.
